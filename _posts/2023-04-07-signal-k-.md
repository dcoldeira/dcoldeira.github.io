As technology advances, more and more devices are being connected to the internet and the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming increasingly popular. This is also true in the world of boating and sailing, where devices such as sensors, GPS modules, and microcontrollers are being used to enhance the sailing experience. One of the most powerful tools for connecting these devices is Signal K, an open-source communication protocol designed specifically for the marine industry. In this article, we will explore what Signal K is, how it works, and how it can be used to set up a server for microcontrollers and other embedded systems. We will also discuss NauticApp, an all-in-one sailing tool app that can connect to a Signal K server to provide real-time data from your boat's electronics.

## What is Signal K?
Signal K is an open-source data format and communication protocol designed for the marine industry. It is designed to be a universal language for marine electronics, allowing different devices to communicate with each other regardless of the manufacturer or model. This means that devices from different manufacturers, such as GPS modules, depth sounders, and autopilots, can all communicate with each other and share data.

## How does Signal K work?
Signal K uses a standard JSON data format to transmit data between devices. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. This makes it an ideal format for transmitting data between different devices.

To set up a Signal K network, you need a server that can receive and transmit data in the Signal K format. This server can be a dedicated device, such as a Raspberry Pi or a computer running a Signal K server software, or it can be a device that already has Signal K support built-in, such as a modern chartplotter or an autopilot.

## Why use Signal K with microcontrollers and embedded systems?
Signal K is particularly useful for connecting microcontrollers and other embedded systems to your boat's electronics. By connecting these devices to a Signal K server, you can easily monitor and control various systems on your boat, such as temperature sensors, battery monitors, and bilge pumps. This allows you to have a more comprehensive view of your boat's systems, and can also help you identify potential issues before they become major problems.

## Introducing NauticApp
[NauticApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.dcoldeira.nauticapp)  is an all-in-one sailing tool app that plans to offer the ability to connect to a Signal K server in the near future, allowing you to access real-time data from your boat's electronics. The app is designed with a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy to monitor and control various systems on your boat, including battery voltage, water depth, and wind speed and direction. NauticApp also allows you to set alarms for specific conditions, such as low battery voltage or high bilge water levels.

Signal K is a powerful tool for connecting marine electronics, and it can be particularly useful when connecting microcontrollers and other embedded systems to your boat's systems. By using a Signal K server, you can have a more comprehensive view of your boat's systems and identify potential issues before they become major problems. With NauticApp, you can access all of this information in one convenient place, making sailing safer and more enjoyable.
