I'm a **full stack developer with a physics degree**, exploring **quantum computing**. This blog documents my journey from classical to quantum programming with hands-on tutorials, code, and visualizations.

**What's here:** Every post is a Jupyter notebook with executable code, quantum circuit visualizations, and actual simulations using Qiskit. Learn by doing, not just reading.
