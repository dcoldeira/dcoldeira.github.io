## Where Quantum Mechanics Meets Production Code

Building quantum computing tools and scientific software with **honest evaluation**, **rigorous physics**, and **production-quality engineering**.

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple"}
## 🔬 Featured Project: Quantum Relational Language (QRL)

**Relations-first quantum programming** where entanglement is a first-class citizen.

- ✅ Stage 0 & 1 Complete: n-qubit entanglement, GHZ states, proper physics
- 🔜 Stage 2 Next: Process algebra & quantum type system
- **[View on GitHub →](https://github.com/dcoldeira/quantum-relational-language)** | **[Read the Docs →](https://github.com/dcoldeira/quantum-relational-language#readme)**

*Not another gate-based framework—this is quantum computing built from first principles.*
:::

**What You'll Find Here:**

- 🔬 **Deep Technical Analysis** - Expert-level quantum computing insights, not tutorials
- ⚛️ **Honest Quantum Evaluation** - Critical assessment of quantum claims and real-world viability
- 🎯 **Physics-Informed Design** - How domain knowledge shapes software architecture
- 🛠️ **Production Experience** - Lessons from building real quantum computing tools
