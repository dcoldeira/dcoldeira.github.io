## Where Quantum Mechanics Meets Production Code

Building quantum computing tools and scientific software with **honest evaluation**, **rigorous physics**, and **production-quality engineering**.

**What You'll Find Here:**

- 🔬 **Deep Technical Analysis** - Expert-level quantum computing insights, not tutorials
- ⚛️ **Honest Quantum Evaluation** - Critical assessment of quantum claims and real-world viability
- 🎯 **Physics-Informed Design** - How domain knowledge shapes software architecture
- 🛠️ **Production Experience** - Lessons from building real quantum computing tools

**Current Focus:** Quantum Process Language (QPL), n-qubit entanglement, GHZ states, and relations-first quantum programming.
