## Research & Open Source

### Quantum Process Language (QPL)
**[GitHub](https://github.com/dcoldeira/quantum-process-language) | 2025 | Active Development**

Educational quantum programming language where entanglement is first-class—teaching quantum mechanics through relations-first programming.

**Recent Milestones:**

- ✅ **Stage 0 Complete**: 2-qubit Bell states, correct cross-basis measurements
- ✅ **Stage 1 Complete**: n-qubit GHZ states, arbitrary entanglement (tested to 5 qubits)
- 🚧 **Stage 2 In Progress**: Process algebra, quantum type system

**Philosophy:**

- **Relations over objects** - Entanglement is fundamental
- **Questions over measurements** - Asking changes the system
- **Processes over gates** - Everything is an interaction
- **Context over absolute** - Observer-dependent reality

**Example:**
```python
# Create 3-qubit GHZ state: (|000⟩ + |111⟩)/√2
program = QPLProgram("GHZ Demo")
q0, q1, q2 = program.create_system(), program.create_system(), program.create_system()
ghz3 = program.entangle(q0, q1, q2)

print(f"Entanglement entropy: {ghz3.entanglement_entropy:.3f}")
# Output: 1.0 (maximally entangled)
```

**Use Case:** Teaching quantum thinking to programmers

**Tech:** Python • NumPy • Quantum state simulation • Tensor networks

**Status:** Core physics verified, n-qubit relations working, ready for educational use

### Quantum Advisor
**[GitHub](https://github.com/dcoldeira/quantum-process-language) | 2025**

The honest quantum computing consultant—tells you whether your problem actually has proven quantum advantage before you waste months implementing it.

**Why It Exists:**

Most quantum computing content is hype. This tool provides **evidence-based assessments** with peer-reviewed citations, honest timelines, and clear recommendations.

**Example Output:**
```
❌ QUANTUM NOT RECOMMENDED for Traveling Salesman Problem

Reason: No proven quantum advantage for general NP-complete problems
Classical: Concorde solver, LKH heuristic (highly effective)
Quantum Status: No demonstrated speedup
Timeline: No advantage expected (fundamental limitation)

References:
- Aaronson & Arkhipov (2011): Quantum complexity theory
- Cook & Cunningham (1997): TSP classical algorithms
```

**Knowledge Base:**

- 4 problem classes (factorization, search, optimization, simulation)
- 3 quantum algorithms (Shor's, Grover's, VQE)
- Evidence-based with citations
- Honest about NISQ limitations vs fault-tolerant era

**Tech:** Python • JSON schema • Curated scientific knowledge

**Status:** Working prototype, expanding knowledge base

### Photon Duality Simulator
**[GitHub](https://github.com/dcoldeira/photon-duality-simulator) | 2025**

Novel theoretical framework proposing that interference patterns arise from interactions between "bright" (detectable) and "dark" (undetectable) photon states.

**Theoretical Contribution:**

- Bright/dark state mathematical formulation
- Testable experimental predictions
- Connections to pilot-wave theory, decoherence, weak measurement

**Features:**

- Interactive parameter exploration
- Animated phase variation visualizations
- Double-slit experiment simulations
- Fringe visibility analysis

**Tech:** Python • NumPy • Matplotlib • SciPy

**Status:** Theoretical framework complete, seeking experimental collaboration

## Scientific Computing

### Principles & Approach

Cross-domain patterns for building software in complex scientific environments.

**Physics-Informed Design**

Domain knowledge drives architecture. Understanding quantum mechanics shapes how QPL handles entanglement. Understanding physics is not optional—it's the foundation.

**Honest Evaluation**

Both geotechnical predictions and quantum algorithms face hype. Rigorous validation and transparent limitations are essential. If something doesn't work, say so.

**Production-Ready Research Code**

Research code shouldn't be throwaway. Build with testing, documentation, and maintainability from day one. QPL has 100% test pass rate because correctness matters.

**Rigorous Physics**

Get the math right. QPL's cross-basis bug fix (Stage 0) demonstrated: assumptions must be tested, quantum mechanics is unforgiving, and correct physics is non-negotiable.
