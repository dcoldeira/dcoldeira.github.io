    "## Summary: The Theory You Need\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand QPL Stage Zero, you need to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Quantum states** are superpositions of basis states, not classical probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Measurement collapses** superposition and is **contextual** (basis-dependent)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Entanglement** is a relation between systems, not a property of systems\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Same-basis measurements** of entangled systems show 100% correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Different-basis measurements** of entangled systems show ~50% correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Entanglement entropy** quantifies correlation via Schmidt decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Basis transformations** ($U^\\dagger$) enable measurement in arbitrary bases\n",
    "\n",
    "**With this foundation, you can now understand why QPL's abstractions—`QuantumRelation`, `QuantumQuestion`, `Perspective`—match the physics of quantum mechanics better than gate-based frameworks.**\n",
