## Quantum Relational Language (QRL) Repository

QRL is now citable! Use the Zenodo DOI in your research:

**[DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18292199](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18292199)**

**[GitHub: dcoldeira/quantum-relational-language](https://github.com/dcoldeira/quantum-relational-language)**

Status: ✅ Published | ✅ Teleportation working | ✅ 47 tests passing
:::

## Two Big Updates

This week brought two important changes to the project:

1. **Published on Zenodo** - Now citable with a permanent DOI
2. **Renamed to QRL** - From "QPL" to "Quantum Relational Language"

Let me explain both.

## Published on Zenodo

**What is Zenodo?**

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is an open-access repository operated by CERN for research outputs. It provides permanent, citable references (DOIs) for software, datasets, and preprints.

**Why publish now?**

[Stage 3](../2026-01-16-qrl-stage-three/) just completed. QRL now has:

- Complete MBQC compiler (graph extraction + pattern generation)
- Adaptive Pauli corrections
- Quantum teleportation with fidelity = 1.0
- 47 passing tests

This is working, tested code. Time to make it officially citable.

**What the DOI gives us:**

- **Permanent reference** - The code snapshot is archived forever
- **Citable in papers** - Others can reference this work properly
- **Timestamp priority** - Establishes when this work was done
- **Professional credibility** - More than "just a GitHub repo"

**How to cite QRL:**

```bibtex
@software{coldeira2026qrl,
  author       = {Coldeira, David},
  title        = {{Quantum Relational Language (QRL): A 
                   relations-first compiler for measurement-based 
                   quantum computing}},
  year         = 2026,
  publisher    = {Zenodo},
  version      = {v0.3.0},
  doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.18292199},
  url          = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18292199}
}
```

## Renamed: QPL → QRL

**The Problem:**

"QPL" is already taken. In 2004, Peter Selinger published [*"Towards a quantum programming language"*](https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/qpl.pdf), describing a quantum programming language called QPL. It's well-established in academic literature with many citations.

Continuing to call this project "QPL" would create confusion and look like I'm unaware of existing work in the field.

**The Solution:**

Rename to **QRL (Quantum Relational Language)**.

This name:
- ✅ Accurately describes the approach (relations-first)
- ✅ Avoids conflict with Selinger's QPL
- ✅ Is memorable and searchable
- ✅ Aligns with the core philosophy (quantum relations as primitives)

**What Changed:**

- Package name: `src/qpl/` → `src/qrl/`
- Main class: `QPLProgram` → `QRLProgram`
- Repository URL: Same (quantum-relational-language)
- All imports and tests updated
- Version bumped: 0.1.0 → 0.2.0

**What Didn't Change:**

- The language design
- The implementation
- The API structure
- The MBQC compiler
- Test suite (all 47 still passing)

This is purely a naming change for academic clarity.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dcoldeira/quantum-relational-language.git
cd quantum-relational-language
pip install -e .
```

**Updated import:**

```python
from qrl import QRLProgram  # Was: from qpl import QPLProgram
from qrl.mbqc import extract_graph, generate_pattern_from_relation
```

---

## Quick Example

```python
from qrl import QRLProgram
from qrl.mbqc import simulate_teleportation, verify_teleportation_fidelity
import numpy as np

# Create arbitrary input state
input_state = np.array([0.6, 0.8])

# Teleport it
output_state, outcomes, corrections = simulate_teleportation(input_state)

# Verify fidelity
fidelity = verify_teleportation_fidelity(input_state, output_state)
print(f"Fidelity: {fidelity}")  # 1.0
```

---

## What's Next

**Stage 4: Photonic Integration**

- Connect QRL to graphix (MBQC framework)
- Test with Perceval simulator
- Target real photonic hardware (Quandela)

**Formal Publication**

- Write LaTeX preprint documenting the approach
- Submit to QPL Workshop 2026 (if CFP opens)
- Aim for IEEE QCE 2026/2027

---

## Summary

**Published:** Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.18292199 (January 18, 2026)

**Renamed:** QPL → QRL (Quantum Relational Language) to avoid conflict with Selinger's QPL (2004)

**Status:** Stage 0-3 complete, 47 tests passing, teleportation fidelity = 1.0

**Next:** Photonic integration and formal publication

The project is now properly named, properly archived, and ready for the next phase.
