## David Coldeira

**Scientific Software Engineer** specializing in quantum computing and physics-informed software design.

I build production-quality tools for complex physical systems—combining deep physics knowledge with rigorous software engineering to create solutions that actually work.

## What I Do

### Quantum Computing Research
Building educational tools and frameworks that make quantum mechanics accessible while maintaining physical rigor.

**Current Projects:**
- **Quantum Process Language (QPL)**: Relations-first quantum programming where entanglement is first-class
- **Quantum Advisor**: Honest evaluation tool for quantum computational advantage
- **Photon Duality Simulator**: Novel theoretical framework for quantum interference

### Scientific Software Engineering
Production systems for complex scientific domains, applying rigorous engineering principles to real-world physics problems.

**Day Job - Laboratory Software Engineering:**
- Lead developer for GQMLab LIMS at Geoquip Marine
- Processing offshore seabed instrument data (GDS, JVtech)
- ML pipelines predicting soil mechanics from field measurements
- Full-stack: Python, Flutter, Docker, PostgreSQL

**Night Job - Quantum Computing Research:**
- QPL: Relations-first quantum programming language
- Quantum Advisor: Honest evaluation of quantum advantage
- Educational tools with production-quality standards

**Cross-Domain Insight:** Both domains require physics-informed design, rigorous correctness, and honest evaluation over hype. The same principles that make geotechnical predictions reliable apply to quantum software.

## Philosophy

### Honest Evaluation Over Hype

Most quantum computing content is hype. I provide **critical, evidence-based analysis** of when quantum computing actually helps (and when it doesn't).

If something doesn't work, I say so. If classical methods are better, I recommend them. Honesty matters more than excitement.

### Physics-Informed Design

Domain knowledge drives architecture. Understanding quantum mechanics shapes how QPL handles entanglement. Understanding soil mechanics influences geotechnical data pipelines.

**The best software for physical systems comes from understanding both the physics and the engineering.**

### Production-Ready Research Code

Research code shouldn't be throwaway. Build with:
- Comprehensive testing (QPL: 100% test pass rate)
- Clear documentation
- Maintainability from day one
- Real-world applicability

### Rigorous Correctness

Get the math right. Quantum mechanics is unforgiving:
- Test assumptions
- Verify against known physics
- Fix bugs thoroughly (see: QPL cross-basis measurement bug fix)

## What This Blog Offers

**Deep Technical Analysis**

Expert-level quantum computing and scientific software insights. Not tutorials—assumes you know programming fundamentals and focuses on the "why" behind architectural decisions.

**Honest Quantum Evaluation**

Critical assessment of quantum computing claims. When does quantum actually help? When are classical methods better? Evidence-based answers with peer-reviewed citations.

**Physics-Informed Design Patterns**

How domain knowledge shapes software architecture. Patterns that work across domains—from quantum computing to geotechnical engineering.

**Real-World Experience**

Lessons from building production scientific software. What actually works? What doesn't? What matters?

## Current Focus

### Stage 1: n-Qubit Relations (Completed)

QPL now supports arbitrary n-qubit entanglement:
- GHZ states up to 5 qubits tested
- General tensor product operations
- Proper measurement and state collapse
- 100% test pass rate

### Stage 2: Process Algebra (Next)

Building quantum type system and process composition for QPL.

### Quantum Advisor Expansion

Growing the knowledge base with more quantum algorithms and problem classes.

## Content Philosophy

**Rigorous over flashy.** Every claim backed by evidence. Honest about limitations. Clear about what works and what doesn't.

**Expert-level, not beginner.** Assumes programming fundamentals and physics basics. Focuses on depth, not breadth.

**Cross-domain insights.** Principles that apply whether you're building geotechnical software or quantum computing tools.

**Production mindset.** Research code should be production-quality. Tools should be usable. Claims should be testable.
