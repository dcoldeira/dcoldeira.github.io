## Current Work

### Quantum Relational Language (QRL)

A quantum programming language where entanglement is a first-class citizen. Relations-first approach that compiles directly to measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC).

**Status:** Stages 0-4 complete | 84 tests | MBQC compiler + quantum teleportation working

**Next:** QPL Workshop 2026 consideration + future direction planning
